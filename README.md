## PyTorch RNN Project: TV Script Generator

Generate a new [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNN/LSTM models. 

For example, given the single word input of "jerry", the model can generate the following fake TV dialogue:

jerry: you got the aids walk in there, i was gonna have to be the best.(george enters)

jerry: what do you mean," what do you think?

jerry: no...

jerry: what? what are you doing?

jerry: i don't want to see him again.

jerry: i can't believe this.

george:(on the phone) hello, kramer.

elaine: oh! oh! oh, hi mom!

elaine: i don't think i have a good time.

george: i can't believe this!(kramer comes over to the kitchen, and then they get out of here, and i'm going to have a good time.

elaine: what is this?

jerry: well, you know, i don't know what it is.

george: i can't.

jerry:(pointing at kramer) i think it's a good thing. i mean, i don't even know what it is, i know.

kramer: oh! i think i can get a new pair of white wine, and i don't know..

jerry: what do you mean," i know that... you know i think it's a little effeminate.

newman: you want to see that guy again.

kramer:(to jerry) hey george, you're the only one who ruined the relationship. you know the ones that ever had to get the ball, and then, when you can get a picture of me!

elaine: you don't have a ticket.

george: oh, i know, i was just trying to get out of the building.

kramer: well, you know, it's not that bad.

kramer: well, you know, you know the guy, i don't know what i was thinking about.

elaine: oh, yeah. yeah, i got some nerve in my life. i can't get out of this cab. i mean, you don't have to be able to get the picture,
